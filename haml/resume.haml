            %p My name is Darko Miladinovikj and I'm a freelance 3D artist located in Skopje, Macedonia. I have roughly a year of professional experience working the game industry. I specialize in hard surface modeling/texturing stuff like weapons, vehicles, props etc. I am proficient with high/low-res modeling, baking, texturing and everything that goes in between. Im a quick learner and Im always open to new learning experiences to help me get my project done in time. I offer fair rates and am available for on and off-site work opportunities.
