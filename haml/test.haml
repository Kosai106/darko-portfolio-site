						%p January 2015 - March 2015 Heroic Stand
						%p Worked as Lead artist for a small independent studio. My responsibilities included managing outsourced material, creation of training videos to speed up the workflow of the team and production. We were assigned with creating next-generation PBR textures for several WW2 vehicles with engine-specific requirements.

						%p April -~ Art Bully Productions
						%p Worked on several next-generation AAA titles with varying requirements. One included doing work for a VR (Virtual Reality) game which required considerably more detail than your average AAA game asset. All assets were held to the higest standards of the game industry.
